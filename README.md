# Voice-Recognition-System
This project implements a basic voice recognition system that records speech using a microphone, extracts audio features such as MFCCs and pitch, and authenticates users by comparing live voice samples with stored templates using cosine similarity. It demonstrates the core steps of voice-based biometric verification.
